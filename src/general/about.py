ABOUT = """I've been developing in frontend development for 2 years now. Currently using stack (React/Redux/TypeScript). Very motivated to develop in this field further, gaining work experience and learning new technologies.

Core skills:

- Strong knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript
- Proficiency in React library (react-router-dom, react-redux etc.)
- Confidence in Redux(Redux Toolkit, redux-persist etc.)
- Good API skills (get, post, put, patch)
- Experience using scss module and styled-component for writing styles
- Good experience with layouts in Figma
- Basic use of GIT

Additional skills:

- Experience writing code in c++, java, python

Currently strengthening my skills in the stack (React/Redux/TypeScript). Developing FullStack Pet-Project together with backend developer. Soon I plan to learn MobX and consolidate my knowledge on a future project.
